# CAUTION

This project was my first foray into programming.
It's jank.

But surprisingly, it works.

I wrote this over the course of a weekend at Insomnia69, as HLSW is becoming increasingly hard to find, and was never user-friendly in the first place.

If CS servers are set up to 'log' to this consumers IP and PORT then the consumer will display each unique server and listen for relevant traffic using (mostly) regex looking for specific terms.

It'll then update the scoreline for each server, and send a Windows notification if a player asks for an admin in any form on the server.

In short, this is a very basic but life-saving tool for CS tournament operators at LAN events if they're not using something heavy like eBot. This tool lets you know the status of each match (difficult to find out otherwise!) and decreases admin response times to player situations dramatically.

Fun little project, and was the inspiration and basis for me looking into programming more deeply and inspired my other project, Horizon CS Manager, which is a far more fleshed out and interactive platform for CS server management using a React and Express based stack instead of Python.
